## Assignment

Created SearchBar with total features of search tools 
Example: Google Search Engine Model



I can make use of the publicly accessible API Service — [Star Wars API — SWAPI](https://swapi.dev/). Use the `/people/` endpoint to search for characters.

## Installing and Running
The repository contains a minimal scaffolding created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). This is only meant as
a starting point and you are free to change the structure if you wish. 

1. To get started, install your dependencies
```
npm install
```

2. Run the app in development mode
```
npm start
```


## 1—Search Component
I had to build a search component to search for characters by name. Similar to how Google's search box works
component to search as the user is typing. Also ensure the user can use the keyboard to navigate the results (Arrow keys and Enter to select)

## 2—Character Page
The user should be able to select a character from search results and view details about the character.  



## 3-Liabraries Used
  1) react-router-dom
  2) @material UI-icons
  3) @material UI-core
  4) Axios
  5) react-loader-sinpper
